    <h2>📥 Part 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing</h2>
    <img src="path/to/part1-full.jpg" alt="Part 1 Full Image">
    <p>
      In this initial phase, we obtained bioactivity data related to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition from the ChEMBL database — a curated repository of bioactive molecules. We filtered the dataset to include only human targets and standardized the units of measurement for bioactivity (IC50). Additionally, we cleaned the data to remove nulls, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring that it was ready for downstream processing. This step lays the foundation for a reliable and meaningful machine learning pipeline by ensuring the data’s integrity and relevance.

    <h2>🧪 Part 2: Descriptor Calculation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
    <img src="path/to/part2-full.jpg" alt="Part 2 Full Image">
    <p>
      After preparing the dataset, we computed a series of molecular descriptors that numerically represent chemical properties such as molecular weight, lipophilicity (LogP), number of hydrogen bond donors, and more. These descriptors serve as the features for our machine learning models. We then conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and correlation of these descriptors across active and inactive compounds. Visualizations like scatter plots and box plots revealed important insights — for example, active compounds tend to occupy a distinct chemical space compared to inactive ones, especially in terms of LogP and molecular weight.

    <h2>📊 Part 3: Dataset Preparation for Machine Learning</h2>
    <img src="path/to/part3-full.jpg" alt="Part 3 Full Image">
    <p>
      Once EDA confirmed the relevance of the descriptors, we proceeded to prepare the data for machine learning. This included normalizing continuous variables, encoding categorical labels (active/inactive), and selecting the most informative features based on domain knowledge and correlation analysis. The final dataset was then split into training and testing subsets to ensure unbiased evaluation. By preparing a clean and structured dataset, we established a robust foundation for model training and ensured reproducibility.

    <h2>🌲 Part 4: Regression Model with Random Forest</h2>
    <img src="path/to/part4-full.jpg" alt="Part 4 Full Image">
    <p>
      In this phase, we trained a Random Forest regression model to predict the pIC50 values of the compounds. Random Forest was selected for its robustness to overfitting and ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships. The model was trained on the molecular descriptors and evaluated using key regression metrics such as R-squared (R²) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results demonstrated strong predictive performance, indicating that molecular descriptors can be effectively used to model compound bioactivity.

    <h2>⚖️ Part 5: Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
    <img src="path/to/part5-full.jpg" alt="Part 5 Full Image">
    <p>
      To validate the model’s performance, we compared the Random Forest model with other regression algorithms including Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Regression. Each model was trained and evaluated using the same dataset and metrics. Through this comparative analysis, we were able to highlight the strengths and limitations of each algorithm in the context of bioactivity prediction. The comparison also underscored the importance of model selection based on the complexity and nature of the data.
